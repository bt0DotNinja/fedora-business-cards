===========================================================

Most of the modules are self-documenting, and running the fedora-business-cards
executable makes things significantly easier. The executable uses the cmdline
frontend in fedora_business_cards.frontend, complete with optparse and all that
fun stuff. However, even with it being easy to use, I'll soon be writing
documentation to make it more clear on how to write your own frontend, if you
like; theoretically, you don't even need to include it in frontend.py, but it'd
certainly be nice.

Known bugs:
* certain glyphs aren't yet available in MgOpen Moderna. The art team is
  working on that.
